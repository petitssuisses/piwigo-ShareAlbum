Share Album is a piwigo plugin to enable simple per album share function.
For any private album, you can generate and share a unique URL that you can share with the users you trust in enough to browse an album.
# Usage
In the administrative area, you can from the Plugin > Share album screens : 
- Individually share albums (create a new share)
- For each shared album, you can : copy the one-click share URL, regenerate this unique link, cancel it
The same features are available when you navigate (as an administrator) in your albums.

Only the publicly accessible pictures in the album show up [#71](https://github.com/petitssuisses/piwigo-ShareAlbum/issues/71)

Administrative functions : 
* Optionally remove breadcrumbs on shared albums
* Optionally hide menus on shared albums (user name not shown, no albums navigation but current album)

# How does the plugin work
From each private album, there's a new "Share" sub menu displayed on the category (album) page.
From this menu, you can share this album.
One shared, you are provided with a unique http(s) link giving access to this album.

Behind the scene :
* A unique Piwigo user is created with a random password assigned. By default, user type is set to 'generic' 
* This user is granted to browse the selected (and only) category album. When logging with the specific link, the user is logged in and redirected

Requirements to share an album : 
- The share function can only be managed by Administrator users
- The share function is only available for private albums
